# Mesh-Simplification

An implementation of a mesh simplification algorithm. the paper that describes this algorithm is included in the project's main Directory.

the algorithm is mainly implemented in the obj_loader file, after parsing the obj file and creating a mesh we simplify it and present the original and the simplified version  side by side for evaluation.
